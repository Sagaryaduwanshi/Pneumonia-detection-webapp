# Pneumonia-detection-webapp

This project is a web application for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a deep learning model. The application allows users to upload a chest X-ray image, and it predicts whether the patient is normal or affected by pneumonia.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Form**: Users can input their personal details such as name, age, gender, and blood group, and upload an X-ray image for analysis.
- **Deep Learning Model**: The backend is powered by a pre-trained deep learning model that predicts the likelihood of pneumonia.
- **Prediction Result**: The application displays the prediction result (Normal or Affected by Pneumonia) after processing the uploaded image.
